Objective
This document describes the cell balancing algorithm in detail. It also provides insights into some of the important concepts pertaining to passive cell balancing. 
General Concepts
Balancing
Cell balancing is a way of compensating for the weaker cells by equalizing the charge on all the cells in the chain, thus extending the battery life. 
Passive balancing allows the stack to look like every cell has the same capacity as the weakest cell. Using a relatively low current, it drains a small amount of energy from high SoC cells during the charging cycle so that all cells charge to their maximum SoC. This is accomplished by using a switch and bleed resistor in parallel with each battery cell.
Free-Safe LT uses passive cell balancing.
Balancing in FreeSafe LT
Architecture


FreeSafe LT products use BQ7694003 AFE. AFE measures and communicates cell voltages to MCU over I2C lines.
MCU processes all cell voltages and based on the balancing algorithm, sends a command to start/stop balancing to the AFE.
The AFE processes the command and starts/stops balancing on requested cells.
FS-LT uses an external balancing circuit.
Fast Voltage Acquisition is used when going from Sleep to Glimpse mode. In Running mode, Fast Voltage Acquisition is not used and cell voltages are updated every 800 milliseconds.

Cell Voltage acquisition
Cell voltages are either acquired using Fast mode or using Normal mode. Fast mode is only used when reading cell voltages in Glimpse mode.

Balancing algorithm

Cell voltages are acquired in runMedium process(100 mS) and the temperature readings are acquired in runSlow process (1 S).
The decision to balance a cell or not is taken in runMedium process and action is taken in runSlow process.
stopBalancingThreshold (ID 28) and forceBalancingThresold (ID 27) are SD card configuration parameters.
After balancing timer expires, balancing is stopped for a loop to get accurate voltage readings. So every time balancing timer(currently set to 5 seconds in FW) elapses, balancing is stopped to get an accurate cell voltage reading.
Appropriate balancing action is taken once cell voltages are read successfully on the next run of the balancing algorithm.
